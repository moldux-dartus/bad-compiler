# bad-compiler

Following along with https://g-ford.github.io/cradle/introduction.html but will turn into a proper instructional when finished and refactored to applicative parsing.

The source project was abandoned but references https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/ as a TurboPascal implementation; will continue from there after refactoring.
